# FreeAds - Web Project

Description

FreeAds is a free ads website made with Laravel.
This project was done at school to practice building web applications in Laravel with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

The website has:

* A Home page with a filter, a search bar, and all ads.
* A Register and Login system.
* A page to show all users.
* A page to show ads dynamically.
* Functions to edit, update, and delete users.



Technologies used

* Frontend: HTML
* Backend: PHP
* Framework: Laravel, Tailwind CSS
* Database: MySQL
* Local server: XAMPP / localhost



## Development steps

1. Design

* Define pages: Home, Login, Signup, Admin.
* Define models and controllers: User, Ads.
* Define views: register, login, admin, index, edit\_user, delete\_user.
* Add authentication and email verification.
* Create the freeAds database and migration.

2. Backend

* Install Composer.
* Create Laravel project.
* Create models and controllers: User, Ads, Category.
* Create migrations for tables.
* Add CRUD functions for users and products.

3. Frontend

* Create views: register, login, admin, index, edit_user, delete_user with HTML/Tailwind.
* Add forms (login, register, add product).

4. Test and Debug

* Test registration and login.
* Test CRUD (add, edit, delete).
* Fix errors.



## Problems and solutions

* Basic design: the interface was too simple.
* Solution: look at other websites and improve with Tailwind CSS.



## Final result

A working website that allows:

* Register and login.
* Add, edit, update, and delete users and ads.

The project works, but design and security can be better.



## Future improvements

* Add images for ads.
* Responsive design (for mobile).
* Better security (protect against SQL injection).
* Add admin dashboard.
